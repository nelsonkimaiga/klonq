### deployed ghost blog
Deploying a ghost bog on heroku


Will document my steps here:
1. Created a repo on github.(This one..only had a readme)
2. Headed over to [ghost.org](http://ghost.org/) and downloaded Ghost(latest version)
3. Clone from github and unzipped ghost in this folder and pretty much did an override on existing files.
4.
